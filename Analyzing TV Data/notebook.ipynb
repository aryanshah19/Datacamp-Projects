TV, halftime shows, and the Big Game\n<p>Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's a little something for everyone at your Super Bowl party. Drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy for the sports fan. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZD1QrIe--_Y?t=14\">riding giant mechanical tigers</a> or <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mjrdywp5nyE?t=62\">leaping from the roof of the stadium</a>. It's a show, baby. And in this notebook, we're going to find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. After exploring and cleaning our data a little, we're going to answer questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are the most extreme game outcomes?</li>\n<li>How does the game affect television viewership?</li>\n<li>How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?</li>\n<li>Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_684/img/left_shark.jpg\" alt=\"Left Shark Steals The Show\">\n<em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/huntleypaton/16464994135/in/photostream/\">Left Shark Steals The Show</a>.

Point difference distribution\n<p>Most combined scores are around 40-50 points, with the extremes being roughly equal distance away in opposite directions. Going up to the highest combined scores at 74 and 75, we find two games featuring dominant quarterback performances. One even happened recently in 2018's Super Bowl LII where Tom Brady's Patriots lost to Nick Foles' underdog Eagles 41-33 for a combined score of 74.</p>\n<p>Going down to the lowest combined scores, we have Super Bowl III and VII, which featured tough defenses that dominated. We also have Super Bowl IX in New Orleans in 1975, whose 16-6 score can be attributed to inclement weather. The field was slick from overnight rain, and it was cold at 46 °F (8 °C), making it hard for the Steelers and Vikings to do much offensively. This was the second-coldest Super Bowl ever and the last to be played in inclement weather for over 30 years. The NFL realized people like points, I guess.</p>\n<p><em>UPDATE: In Super Bowl LIII in 2019, the Patriots and Rams broke the record for the lowest-scoring Super Bowl with a combined score of 16 points (13-3 for the Patriots).</em></p>\n<p>Let's take a look at point <em>difference</em> now.</p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"24"},"tags":["sample_code"],"collapsed":true,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Plot a histogram of point differences\nplt.hist(super_bowls['difference_pts'])\nplt.xlabel('Point Difference')\nplt.ylabel('Number of Super Bowls')\nplt.show()\n\n# Display the closest game(s) and biggest blowouts\ndisplay(super_bowls[super_bowls['difference_pts'] == 1])\ndisplay(super_bowls[super_bowls['difference_pts'] >= 35])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"31"},"deletable":false,"editable":false,"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 5. Do blowouts translate to lost viewers?\n<p>The vast majority of Super Bowls are close games. Makes sense. Both teams are likely to be deserving if they've made it this far. The closest game ever was when the Buffalo Bills lost to the New York Giants by 1 point in 1991, which was  best remembered for Scott Norwood's last-second missed field goal attempt that went <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPFZCGgjDSg\">wide right</a></em>, kicking off four Bills Super Bowl losses in a row. Poor Scott.

The game was never really close. I'm pretty sure we changed the channel at the end of the third quarter. Let's combine our game data and TV to see if this is a universal phenomenon.
